    %h4 Problem and Solution
    %p Courier and delivery services are unclear about their pricing plans, can charge rates greater than $170 per pound, fuel charges, as well as weekend surcharges, and are often unable to promise same-day delivery. By harnessing space in the bags of those already travelling between major delivery locations, BringMyStuff gets invidividuals cheaper rates and quicker and reliable transportation of packages!

    %h4 Some Intersting Data
    %p On a given day, about 2 million individuals fly in the domestic United States. If even 0.5% of those individuals, are able to deliver goods on their routes for some side money, thatâ€™s 10,000 packages that could be delivered on a given day!

    %h3 Team
    %p We're based in San Francisco, CA. We like burritos and bicycles.
